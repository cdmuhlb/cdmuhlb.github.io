      <description>As a hobbyist whose experience is mostly limited to my own equipment, I’ll try to refrain from “reviews” based on a sample size of one. Instead, I’ll simply offer my comments on what gear I’ve chosen to buy and how it’s worked out for me.
Pentax K-x (entry-level DSLR) It was a great first DSLR. Small, high image quality, intermediate-level features, and the flexibility to use AA batteries. But its ergonomics don’t hold a candle to the K-5, and its plasticy build creaks a bit more with each passing year.</description>

      <title>Integrating 3D controls to propagate desired state</title>

      <description>Suppose you have a sensor that integrates body rates and velocities and reports these measurements over arbitrary intervals. And let’s further suppose that it’s reasonable to assume that those body rates and velocities are constant during each interval. How should we propagate the position and attitude of this sensor?
First, it’s fair to ask what real-life situations this could reflect. Constant body rates would apply to inertial motion with rotation about stable principal axes and could be integrated by a gyro.</description>

      <title>X11 input configs</title>

      <description>Sometimes you plug a new peripheral into your Linux machine and it fails to “just work.” And all too often, even with Google’s assistance, the fix is difficult to find (if a satisfactory solution can be found at all). Here I’m documenting the settings I’ve found for a few input devices that don’t quite work out-of-the-box.
Configuration overview Configs for X11 on Linux have moved around a lot over the years.</description>

      <title>Terminal tips</title>

      <description>A command-line terminal can be great for productivity. But while sticking with defaults may keep you portable, customized settings (along with practice of advanced features) are really the keys to improved comfort and efficiency. These are a few that I find especially useful.
Environment variables Many pieces of software actually respect some useful shell environment variables. The most significant one on modern systems is EDITOR, which should of course be reset to /usr/bin/vim.</description>

      <description>How does one take a picture of the Milky Way? With good technique and the right equipment you can do so with a camera, an opportunity I try not to miss when vacationing under the dark skies of the American West (see photo). But stray light and sensor noise limit the dynamic range achievable with this technique. Is there another approach? Well, if we knew where all the stars in the night sky were, we could render their light with any brightness, field-of-view, or PSF we wished.</description>

      <title>Polynomial fitting pitfalls</title>

      <description>A common task in research is to represent trends in a dataset by a smooth analytic function. If a physical model for the trend exists, then the goal is to fit for the parameters of the model. In other situations, however, no good model is available, so one tries instead to represent the trend with a general functional form or a basis function expansion. Polynomials are a popular choice, partially thanks to their general familiarity and their role in Taylor series.</description>

      <title>Objects vs. actors</title>

      <description>Reactive programming is all the rage these days, and it brings with it a suite of new abstractions and paradigms. The Scala language provides a fantastic environment for deploying these new reactive techniques, bridging the gap between functional and object-oriented programming and enabling clean interfaces for tools like futures and actors. While the Internet is already full of information and tutorials about these concepts, I thought a simple comparison of some of the core abstractions might help clarify things in a learner’s mind.</description>

      <title>Surprise citations</title>

      <description>Once you post something to the Internet, it’s there for the world to find and do with as it sees fit. This often results in your work being referenced in contexts where it (in your opinion) really doesn’t belong. In particular, students and academic enthusiasts are often unable to discern expert research from amateur writeups, especially if the latter are well-typeset. Other times, though, you may be surprised at the reach and value of your old work.</description>

      <title>Taming LightDM</title>
      <link>http://www.muhlbergerweb.com/writing/technical_tips/taming_lightdm/</link>

      <description>Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (the Precise Pangolin) uses LightDM as its display manager. While attractive out-of-the-box, it continues the recent trend in display managers of offering far less functionality than we had 5 years ago. Simple settings, like “please don’t let strangers use my computer,” are lacking from its interface. Fortunately, there are some low-level controls that help make LightDM a little more bearable.
Guest users There’s no doubt that guest sessions can be convenient in many circumstances, but there are plenty of others in which unauthorized users should not be allowed to access a given piece of hardware.</description>

      <title>Pentax K-5 review</title>

      <description>Simply one of the best APS-C DSLRs you can buy. The 14-bit sensor offers tremendous dynamic range, allowing raw files processed in Lightroom 4 to exhibit fantastic detail in all tonal regions. Judging from more technical reviews, it appears to offer the best image quality to be found short of full-frame. And Pentax’s ergonomics and user interfaces are always comfortable and intuitive, offering easy access to the controls you actually want.</description>

      <description>My name is Curran Muhlberger, and I am a software engineer at SpaceX.
Until recently, I conducted research in the field of numerical relativity, simulating the interactions of black holes and neutron stars. Prior to that I attended the University of Maryland, College Park, receiving degrees in physics, mathematics, and astronomy.
My technical interests include software architecture, high-performance computing, Bayesian inference, signal processing (particularly for audio and images), cryptography &amp;amp; security, web design, and numerical solutions to partial differential equations.</description>
